    body: `With Chris Liepe’s course, Perfect Vocal Takes, reopening for students this Tuesday...

It’s time we pulled the curtain back and let you have a look inside the course, to see what it’s all about.

With that, we’re going to give you one of the 3 in-depth vocal walkthroughs inside the course…

Where you’ll get to see Chris revisit an old song he’s made as a producer/vocalist for hire, and then re-track and craft a compelling, professional vocal performance, all while explaining what he’s doing at every step of the process.

(You’ll find the link to the walkthrough at the bottom of this email)

We like to think that the best vocal takes were made by a singer rolling up to the mic half asleep, and magic just comes out of their mouth…

But unless you’re a gifted vocal talent - that’s simply not possible. 

But by applying the critical, yet artistic approach that Chris shows inside this walkthrough, you’ll see how he puts together a cohesive, emotionally captivating performance as a result.

So what’s inside Perfect Vocal Takes? 

Inside Chris’s course, “Perfect Vocal Takes”, you’ll see him break down the crucial mindsets needed to craft amazing vocal takes, warm up your voice, explore its registers, and then be shown how Chris crafts a perfect vocal take in 3 separate tracks.

The course consists of 3 in-depth modules that are structured to help you discover and develop your vocal recording skills, and achieve great vocal performances from a home studio. 

Module 1 gives you The Winning Vocal Mindsets that Chris has discovered over years of vocal trial and error and coaching hundreds of students to discover their voice. 

You’ll be shown how to create a “Perfect Vocal Chain” that gives you the flexibility and power of an expensive recording studio right from the comfort of your home studio…

How to make sure your recording environment is set up to capture the best vocal recordings possible…

As well as the #1 mindset that stops most vocalists from getting great vocal performances in the first place. 

Module 2 is all about Warming Up & Exploring Your Voice, where Chris reveals his best vocal exercises to get you loose on the microphone, and have your voice warm and ready for recording a great performance. 

You’ll discover how to warm up by “warming down”, as well as how to feel out your voice’s range and power on recording day itself… 

A simple “countdown exercise” that gets you energized and ready to record vocals with…

And Chris’s relied-on vocal effects to make recording feel as effortless as singing in the shower.

This module will show you how to protect your vocal health when recording, and how to dial in your voice on recording day. 

Finally, Module 3 is all about Real World Song Case Studies, where Chris shows you just how to craft great vocal takes in 3 songs of completely different genres. 

From a tender acoustic singer-songwriter song to an upbeat rock track, and then a heavy metal track, you’ll be shown how to nail a professional, compelling vocal in a variety of genres.

You’ll be shown: 

How to create seamless vocal performances even if you have to punch in takes to create the best performance on tape
Why most vocal comps don’t sound as good as they should be (and the simple fix to this)
How to craft different types of voices and supporting vocal tracks in your arrangements to have a powerful, engaging vocal performance, even if you’re not confident in your vocal skills
What storytelling has to do with giving vocal performances that stand out from your first word to your last
Why vocal arranging is far simpler than it looks, and simple ways to turn a lead vocal into a powerful choir without burning your voice out
And what makes the case studies so powerful is that Chris will literally record and create these vocal performances in front of you.

You’ll see him fail, you’ll see him nail takes, you’ll see him listen back, analyze, and point out things that most vocalists wouldn’t spot when recording their own voice. 

You’ll see how he builds vocal arrangements from the ground up, and have a complete insider’s look on how to craft amazing vocals from your home studio. 

By the time you’re done with Perfect Vocal Takes - your vocals will never be the same ever again.

So how much will Perfect Vocal Takes cost? 

Well, a private lesson with Chris Liepe costs $300…

And while Perfect Vocal Takes costs $147, as part of Chris Liepe collaborating with the Recording Revolution this month… 

We’ll be reopening Perfect Vocal Takes at the massively discounted price of just $67 for lifetime access to the course. 

We’ll be opening up the course this Tuesday, but for now…

We’ve got one last sneak peek from Perfect Vocal Takes for you.

It’s an entire vocal case study where Chris crafts a perfect vocal take for an upbeat rock song from start to finish. 

You’ll see how he approaches the lead vocal, how he builds the backing vocal arrangements, and adds ad-libs and characters in the vocal performance to create something extraordinary.

Click here to see Chris craft a perfect vocal take for an upbeat rock song. 

Here’s to your music!

A simple “countdown exercise” that gets you energized and ready to record vocals with…

And Chris’s relied-on vocal effects to make recording feel as effortless as singing in the shower.

This module will show you how to protect your vocal health when recording, and how to dial in your voice on recording day. 

Finally, Module 3 is all about Real World Song Case Studies, where Chris shows you just how to craft great vocal takes in 3 songs of completely different genres. 

From a tender acoustic singer-songwriter song to an upbeat rock track, and then a heavy metal track, you’ll be shown how to nail a professional, compelling vocal in a variety of genres.

You’ll be shown: 

How to create seamless vocal performances even if you have to punch in takes to create the best performance on tape
Why most vocal comps don’t sound as good as they should be (and the simple fix to this)
How to craft different types of voices and supporting vocal tracks in your arrangements to have a powerful, engaging vocal performance, even if you’re not confident in your vocal skills
What storytelling has to do with giving vocal performances that stand out from your first word to your last
Why vocal arranging is far simpler than it looks, and simple ways to turn a lead vocal into a powerful choir without burning your voice out
And what makes the case studies so powerful is that Chris will literally record and create these vocal performances in front of you.

You’ll see him fail, you’ll see him nail takes, you’ll see him listen back, analyze, and point out things that most vocalists wouldn’t spot when recording their own voice. 

You’ll see how he builds vocal arrangements from the ground up, and have a complete insider’s look on how to craft amazing vocals from your home studio. 

By the time you’re done with Perfect Vocal Takes - your vocals will never be the same ever again.

So how much will Perfect Vocal Takes cost? 

Well, a private lesson with Chris Liepe costs $300…

And while Perfect Vocal Takes costs $147, as part of Chris Liepe collaborating with the Recording Revolution this month… 

We’ll be reopening Perfect Vocal Takes at the massively discounted price of just $67 for lifetime access to the course. 

We’ll be opening up the course this Tuesday, but for now…

We’ve got one last sneak peek from Perfect Vocal Takes for you.

It’s an entire vocal case study where Chris crafts a perfect vocal take for an upbeat rock song from start to finish. 

You’ll see how he approaches the lead vocal, how he builds the backing vocal arrangements, and adds ad-libs and characters in the vocal performance to create something extraordinary.

Click here to see Chris craft a perfect vocal take for an upbeat rock song. 

Here’s to your music!

    body: `With Chris Liepe’s course, Perfect Vocal Takes, reopening for students this Tuesday...

It’s time we pulled the curtain back and let you have a look inside the course, to see what it’s all about.

With that, we’re going to give you one of the 3 in-depth vocal walkthroughs inside the course…

Where you’ll get to see Chris revisit an old song he’s made as a producer/vocalist for hire, and then re-track and craft a compelling, professional vocal performance, all while explaining what he’s doing at every step of the process.

(You’ll find the link to the walkthrough at the bottom of this email)

We like to think that the best vocal takes were made by a singer rolling up to the mic half asleep, and magic just comes out of their mouth…

But unless you’re a gifted vocal talent - that’s simply not possible. 

But by applying the critical, yet artistic approach that Chris shows inside this walkthrough, you’ll see how he puts together a cohesive, emotionally captivating performance as a result.

So what’s inside Perfect Vocal Takes? 

Inside Chris’s course, “Perfect Vocal Takes”, you’ll see him break down the crucial mindsets needed to craft amazing vocal takes, warm up your voice, explore its registers, and then be shown how Chris crafts a perfect vocal take in 3 separate tracks.

The course consists of 3 in-depth modules that are structured to help you discover and develop your vocal recording skills, and achieve great vocal performances from a home studio. 

Module 1 gives you The Winning Vocal Mindsets that Chris has discovered over years of vocal trial and error and coaching hundreds of students to discover their voice. 

You’ll be shown how to create a “Perfect Vocal Chain” that gives you the flexibility and power of an expensive recording studio right from the comfort of your home studio…

How to make sure your recording environment is set up to capture the best vocal recordings possible…

As well as the #1 mindset that stops most vocalists from getting great vocal performances in the first place. 

Module 2 is all about Warming Up & Exploring Your Voice, where Chris reveals his best vocal exercises to get you loose on the microphone, and have your voice warm and ready for recording a great performance. 

You’ll discover how to warm up by “warming down”, as well as how to feel out your voice’s range and power on recording day itself… 

A simple “countdown exercise” that gets you energized and ready to record vocals with…
